# `express-template`

## What is it?

This repository is some boilerplate for getting started with an Express web server with TypeScript. It uses Rollup as module bundler (i.e. `.ts` -> `.js`). Simply extend the `app.ts` with more endpoints and your custom business logic.

## Deploying

It is suggested to use something like [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [fly.io](https://fly.io/) to deploy the application.
